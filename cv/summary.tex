\cvsection{Summary}
	Minimalist frontend and backend design is what I strive for. I am an aspiring full-stack web developer and a student at Wake Technical Community College. I am a highly motivated learner who is always working to improve while being as efficient as possible. I have spent the last year learning Ruby on Rails and React as a technology stack with online courses to learn industry best practices.
